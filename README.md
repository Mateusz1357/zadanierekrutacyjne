AccessVerifier and ClientDataManager
This project comprises two microservices—AccessVerifier and ClientDataManager—designed to manage and verify client access based on IP addresses from the AWS eu-west-1 region.

Overview
AccessVerifier: Validates incoming requests against allowed IP ranges.
ClientDataManager: Forwards requests to AccessVerifier and processes the responses.
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Docker (optional, for containerization)
Kubernetes (optional, for deployment)
